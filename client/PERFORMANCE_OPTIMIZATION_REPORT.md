## Technical Implementation Details

### Vite Configuration Enhancements

```typescript
// React 19 specific optimizations
react({
  jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
}),
build: {
  modulePreload: { polyfill: false },
  target: 'es2022',
  rollupOptions: {
    // Advanced chunking strategy
    manualChunks: (id) => {
      // Optimized chunk generation
    }
  }
}
```

### Vercel Configuration

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*).js",
      "headers": [{ "key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" }]
    }
  ],
  "images": {
    "formats": ["image/webp", "image/avif"],
    "sizes": [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840]
  }
}
```
